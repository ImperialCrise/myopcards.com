## Tech stack

| Layer      | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| Backend   | PHP 8.4, PDO/MySQL 8 |
| Frontend  | HTML5, Tailwind CSS (CDN), Alpine.js, Chart.js, Lucide icons |
| Auth      | Session + optional Discord OAuth |
| Data      | [OPTCG API](https://optcgapi.com) (cards + TCGPlayer USD), Cardmarket (EUR via FlareSolverr or CSV) |
| Infra     | Apache 2.4, HTTPS (e.g. Let’s Encrypt), Docker (FlareSolverr) |

---

## Requirements

- PHP 8.4+ with extensions: `pdo_mysql`, `curl`, `json`, `mbstring`
- MySQL 8.0+
- Apache with `mod_rewrite` (or equivalent URL rewriting)
- Optional: Docker (for FlareSolverr, used for Cardmarket scraping)

---

## Installation

### 1. Clone and dependencies

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ImperialCrise/myopcards.com.git
cd myopcards.com
composer install
```

### 2. Environment

Copy environment variables and edit as needed:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Required variables:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `APP_NAME` | Application name (e.g. MyOPCards) |
| `APP_URL` | Full base URL (e.g. https://myopcards.com) |
| `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_DATABASE`, `DB_USERNAME`, `DB_PASSWORD` | MySQL connection |
| `OPTCG_API_BASE` | `https://optcgapi.com/api` |
| `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID`, `DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET`, `DISCORD_REDIRECT_URI` | For Discord login (optional) |
| `FLARESOLVERR_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:8192/v1` if using Docker FlareSolverr (optional) |

### 3. Database

Create the database and user, then run migrations:

```bash
php bin/migrate.php
```

### 4. Web server

- Document root: `public/`
- Enable `mod_rewrite` and point requests to `public/index.php` (see `public/.htaccess`).
- Use HTTPS in production (e.g. Certbot).

### 5. FlareSolverr (optional, for Cardmarket EUR)

To scrape Cardmarket (Cloudflare‑protected), run a dedicated FlareSolverr instance:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This starts FlareSolverr on `127.0.0.1:8192`. Set `FLARESOLVERR_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8192/v1` in `.env`.

## Price updating (summary)

- **USD** — Fetched from OPTCG API (TCGPlayer). Run `php bin/sync-prices.php tcgplayer` (e.g. daily).
- **EUR (EN/FR/JP)** — From Cardmarket:
  - With FlareSolverr: same script with `cardmarket en|fr|jp [limit]` (e.g. 100 per run to avoid rate limits).
  - Without: use Admin → Prices → CSV import (`card_set_id`, `price_en`, `price_fr`, `price_jp`).

Sync runs are logged in the database; view them in **Admin → Logs**.

---

## Admin panel

- URL: `/admin` (requires admin user).
- First admin is set in the database (`users.is_admin = 1` for the chosen user).
- Sections: Dashboard, Users, Cards (with edit), Prices (sync buttons, CSV import), Sync logs.
